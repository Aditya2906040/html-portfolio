<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ADITYA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is one of the most mind blowing movie and it makes you think alot.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  This is one of those classic movies with a slow great buildup and a mind
  blowing climax.
</p>
<h3>Fast 5</h3>
<p>
  In the argument many might say that FnF 6 is the best movie in the franchise
  but according to me Fast 5 is the best movie of the franchise.
